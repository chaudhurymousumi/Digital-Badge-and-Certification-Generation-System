# Digital-Badge-and-Certification-Generation-System
Digital Badge and Certification Generation System using Python, Django, Bootstrap

A digital badge and certificate generation software that is introduced to users on a web portal. 
The portal allows users to register, log into their personal dashboard, reset their password, monitor their acquired certificates, and request a new badge/certificate from many organizations. 
Users can also share their acquired badges/certifications via a public link, or they can download it as a pdf printable version. 
System admins can approve an organization to be registered on the system so that they can utilize many of the functions. Organizations on the other hand can use an API to access the system so that they can review certificate/badge requests from users and approve or reject them. In case of approval, user's data will be automatically added to the certificate, and it will be issued with a unique number. All issued certificates will be linked to the user's account and can be viewed via their dashboard. In addition, organizations will have access to many customizable templates, so they can edit it according to their visual requirements.
